# 👵 THE "MOM TEST" - Cortex Desktop for Complete Beginners

**If your mom (who's never coded) can follow this guide, ANYONE can use Cortex Desktop!**

## 🌟 What is Cortex Desktop?

Think of it like **Siri or Alexa, but for building apps and websites**.

Instead of asking "What's the weather?" you ask:
- "Build me a shopping list app"
- "Create a website for my business"
- "Help me learn how to code"

And it **actually does it** - giving you working code you can use immediately.

**The special part?** It remembers every conversation you have with it. So you never have to repeat yourself!

## 📥 SETUP (Explained Like You're 5)

### Step 1: Get Python (5 minutes)

**What is Python?**
It's free software that lets Cortex work. Think of it like installing Microsoft Word - you download it once and then you can use it forever.

**How to get it:**

1. **Go to**: python.org/downloads

**How do I know it worked?**
- Open "PowerShell" (search for it in Windows start menu)
- Type: `python --version`
- Press Enter
- If you see "Python 3.something" - YOU'RE GOOD! ✅

---

### Step 2: Run the Magic Setup File (2 minutes)

**What does this do?**
It automatically installs everything Cortex needs to work. You don't have to understand it - just click and wait!

**How to do it:**

1. **Open File Explorer** (the folder icon)
2. **Go to**: Desktop → projects folder → PAPI Central
3. **Look for a file called**: `LAUNCH_CORTEX.bat`
   - It looks like a little window/gear icon
4. **Double-click it** (just like opening any file)
5. **A black window opens** - DON'T PANIC! This is normal!
6. **You'll see text scrolling** - it's installing stuff
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
8. **A menu appears** with numbers 1-5

**What do I choose?**
- Press `3` (this starts everything)
- Press Enter

**What happens next?**
- A web page opens in your browser
- You see a cool purple/blue screen with a terminal
- **YOU'RE DONE!** 🎉

---

### Step 3: Talk to Your AI! (Fun part!)

You should see a screen that looks like a computer terminal with:
- A box at the bottom to type in
- The words "Cortex>" before the box

**Try typing these:**

#### Example 1: Get Help
```
Type: ask What can you help me with?
Press Enter
```
Cortex will explain what it can do!

#### Example 2: Build Something
```
Type: ask Build me a simple calculator
Press Enter
```
Wait 5-10 seconds... Cortex will give you the code!

#### Example 3: Learn Something
```
Type: ask Explain what HTML is like I'm 10 years old
Press Enter
```
It explains in simple terms!

#### Example 4: Project Ideas
```
Type: ask Recommend a beginner project for me
Press Enter
```
Get personalized suggestions!

## 🤔 Common Questions (No Stupid Questions!)

### "What if I break something?"
**You can't!** Everything runs on your computer. Worst case, you close the window and reopen it. That's it!

### "Do I need to know how to code?"
**Nope!** Cortex writes the code FOR you. You just describe what you want in normal English.

### "What if it doesn't understand me?"
**Just ask differently!** Like talking to a person - if they don't understand, rephrase it.

### "How much does it cost?"
**Free demo works forever!** Paid version ($30/month) has more features, but you can test everything free first.

### "Is it safe?"
**100% safe!** Everything stays on YOUR computer. No one sees your conversations except you.

### "Can I use it without internet?"
**Yes and no:** The free demo works offline. To use with full AI (OpenAI, Claude, etc.), you need internet.

### "What if I need help?"
**You have options:**
- Read the help docs (comes with it)
- Email: troy@papicentral.com
- Or just ask Cortex itself! Type: `ask How do I...`

## 🎨 Real Example: Making a Birthday Countdown

**Imagine you want a webpage that counts down to your birthday.**

**You type:**
```
ask Create a countdown timer to December 25th with a festive background
```

**Cortex gives you:**
- Full HTML code
- CSS for making it pretty
- JavaScript for the countdown
- Instructions on how to save and open it

**You:**
1. Copy the code
2. Open Notepad
3. Paste the code
4. Save as "birthday.html"
5. Double-click the file
6. **BAM!** Your countdown timer works!

**That simple!**

## 🏆 What Makes Cortex Special?

### Problem with Normal AI (ChatGPT, etc.):
**You:** "Build me a todo app"
**ChatGPT:** [Gives you code]

**You:** "Can you make it purple?"
**ChatGPT:** "Make what purple?"
😤 **It forgot what you were talking about!**

### With Cortex:
**You:** "Build me a todo app"
**Cortex:** [Gives you code]

**You:** "Can you make it purple?"
**Cortex:** "Sure! Here's the updated todo app in purple:"
😊 **It remembers!**

**This saves SO much time!**

## 📱 What You CAN Build (Real Examples)

## 🚫 What You CAN'T Do (Be Realistic)

**Cortex is amazing but it's not magic!**

❌ **Can't** build the next Facebook (that takes teams of people)
❌ **Can't** hack into anything (that's illegal anyway)
❌ **Can't** make you rich overnight (but can help you build tools to start a business!)
❌ **Can't** replace learning entirely (you'll still learn as you go)

**Think of it like:** Having a really smart tutor who remembers everything and writes code for you.

## 💡 Pro Tips (From Someone Who "Gets It")

### Tip 1: Talk Like a Human
**❌ Bad:** "function create element"
**✅ Good:** "Can you help me add a button to my webpage?"

### Tip 2: Be Specific

**✅ Specific:** "Make a website for my bakery with a menu and contact form"

### Tip 3: Ask Follow-Ups
**Don't be shy!** If you don't understand something, ask:
- "Can you explain that simpler?"
- "What does that code do?"
- "Can you add more comments?"

### Tip 4: Save Your Work
When Cortex gives you code, copy it to Notepad and SAVE IT! Give it a name like "my-todo-app.html"

### Tip 5: Don't Be Afraid to Experiment
**You can't break the internet!** Try different things. If it doesn't work, just ask Cortex to fix it!
