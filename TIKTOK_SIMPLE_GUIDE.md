## 🎤 THE SCRIPT (Just read this naturally):

**OPTION 1: "The Simple Version" (45 seconds)**

---

[Look at camera, smile]

**"I'm 62 years old.**

**In 1995, I was buying old computers from thrift stores.**

**286s. 386s. Learning DOS commands because I couldn't afford Windows.**

[Pause]

**30 years later?**

**I just built an AI platform that generates apps in minutes.**

[Show Cortex App Studio on screen if you can, or just keep talking]

**Those command prompts I learned? My superpower.**

**That patience from fixing old computers? My advantage.**

**I wrote a song about AI on December 27th.**

**12 days later, I built the actual product.**

[Point at camera]

**If you think you're too old to start something new...**

**You're wrong.**

**I keep it real. Try PAPI Central. Link in bio."**

## 🆘 IF YOU GET STUCK:

**Problem:** "I don't know how to prop my phone"
**Solution:** Stack books. Lean phone against coffee mug. Use literally anything.

**Problem:** "Lighting looks bad"
**Solution:** Face a window. Or turn on ALL the lights in room.

**Problem:** "I messed up the words"
**Solution:** Just record again. TikTok is free. Unlimited takes.

**Problem:** "I feel awkward on camera"
**Solution:** Record 3 takes. Pick the one where you smile. Post it.

**Problem:** "I don't know what hashtags to use"
**Solution:** Just copy the ones I wrote above. They work.

1. Sit at your computer
2. Open phone camera (selfie mode)
