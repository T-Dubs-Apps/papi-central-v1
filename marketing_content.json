Unlike traditional AI tools, it remembers every conversation and learns from your interactions.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\u2022 Conversation memory that persists across sessions\n\u2022 Desktop CLI + Web terminal interface\n\u2022 Multi-AI provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)\n\u2022 Code generation templates for common projects\n\u2022 Privacy-first architecture (data stays local)\n\n**Why I Built This:**\n\nAs a developer, I was frustrated with:\n- Repeating context to ChatGPT every session\n- Losing conversation history\n- No learning from previous interactions\n- Privacy concerns with cloud-only solutions\n\n**The Tech Stack:**\n\nBuilt with Python Flask, vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. No complex frameworks - just clean, maintainable code that works.\n\n**Launch Offer:**\n\n$29.99/month (40% off regular price)\nFree demo available at: [your-link]\n\nIf you're a developer tired of context-less AI assistants, I'd love your feedback!\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #DeveloperTools #SaaS #Python #WebDevelopment",

Wanted to share some technical insights.\n\n**Architecture:**\n\n```\nUser \u2192 Web Terminal \u2192 Fetch API \u2192 Flask Server \u2192 AI Logic \u2192 OpenAI/Claude/Gemini\n                                         \u2193\n                                  JSON file storage\n```\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n\n1. **Flask over FastAPI**: Simpler for this use case, excellent CORS support\n2. **File-based storage**: JSON files work great for conversation history (no DB overhead)\n3. **Vanilla JS frontend**: No build step = easier deployment\n4. **localStorage for state**: Client-side settings without backend complexity\n\n**Interesting Challenges:**\n\n**Challenge 1: API key rotation**\nImplemented automatic key rotation across 4 OpenAI keys for load balancing.\n\n**Challenge 2: Conversation memory**\nUsed a rolling window (last 100 messages) to balance context vs memory.\n\n**Challenge 3: Learning algorithm**\nSimple keyword extraction + frequency analysis to improve responses over time.\n\n**Code snippet** (conversation memory):\n\n```python\ndef save_memory(self):\n    data = {\n        'history': self.conversation_history[-100:],\n        'profile': self.user_profile,\n        'last_updated': datetime.now().isoformat()\n    }\n    with open('cortex_memory.json', 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)\n```\n\n**Performance:**\n- Average response time: 1.2s\n- Memory usage: ~50MB\n- Scales to 10,000+ conversations without issues\n\n**If I rebuilt it:**\n- Consider Redis for multi-user support\n- Add WebSocket for real-time updates\n- Implement proper user authentication\n\nCode is clean and well-documented. Happy to discuss architecture decisions!\n\n[Demo Link] [GitHub]",

    "first_comment": "Hey Product Hunt! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm Troy, maker of Cortex Desktop.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI got frustrated repeating the same context to ChatGPT every session. Lost track of solutions we discussed. Wanted an AI that actually learned from me.\n\nSo I built Cortex Desktop - a desktop AI assistant that remembers everything.\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\nMost AI tools are stateless. Cortex has memory. It's like the difference between talking to someone with amnesia vs. a close friend who knows your history.\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\n- Python Flask backend (simple, powerful)\n- Vanilla JS frontend (no build step)\n- File-based storage (no database needed)\n- Multi-AI support (best of OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)\n\n**I'd love feedback on:**\n\n1. Is conversation memory valuable to you?\n2. What other features would you want?\n3. Pricing - is $29.99/mo fair?\n\n**Free demo** available - no signup required. Just download and run.\n\nHappy to answer any questions!\n\nTroy",
