### Thread 1: The Origin Story
```
I'm 62 years old.

I learned computers from 286s in San Diego thrift stores in 1995.

30 years later, I'm building cutting-edge AI tools.

This is my story. 🧵

(1/10)

---

In 1995, I'd walk downtown San Diego hitting every thrift store.

Buying 086, 286, 386, 486 computers for pocket change.

Stacked them around my spare room walls like trophies.

Got lucky if ANY of them had Windows.

So I learned DOS. Command prompts. The hard way.

For 10 years, I ran my own computer service business.

Not in Silicon Valley. Right here in my community.

Fixed computers for:
• The Rotary Club
• McDonald's  
• California State Parks
• Narcotics taskforce
• Small businesses

Real people. Real problems. Real solutions.

(3/10)

---

I became:
• Microsoft Registered Partner
• MSDST Certified (A+ equivalent)
• HP Certified Tech
• Electronics repair specialist

Learned to flash HP hard drives to save time.

Designed networks. Installed security systems.

Taught people how to actually USE technology.

But here's the thing...

I've ALSO been playing drums and writing songs since I was 14.

I'm 62 now. That's 48 YEARS of music.

Sound engineer. Audio producer. Drummer.

Two passions: Technology and music.

Fast forward to December 27, 2025.

I'm messing around with Suno AI.

I write lyrics about AI making us smarter, not work harder.

I produce a hip-hop/country/reggae fusion called "I Keep It Real"

Listen: https://suno.com/s/opZd3WQEdxAXHlU2

(6/10)

In the song I wrote:

"I'm about to release something that no one's ever seen
You can find it everywhere, it just might be obscene
I'm the type of man that wants to make you feel so happy
I guess that's why the kids all call me P.A.P.I."

I didn't know it yet, but I was predicting the future.

(7/10)

---

12 days later...

I launched PAPI Central.

Cortex App Studio. The Cortex Desktop. Aegis Security.

AI-powered tools that let ANYONE build apps without coding.

The exact thing I was singing about.

The song became reality.

(8/10)

---

People ask: "How do you compete with young developers?"

I don't.

30 years of DOS commands > 6 months of bootcamp.

48 years of storytelling > perfect syntax.

I know what to say to a polite AI model.

Because I've spent my life serving real people.

(9/10)

Today I:
• Exercise my brain
• Choose my hours  
• Feel like I'm accomplishing something
• Know my tools help people
• Enjoy my songs

From 286s to AI.
From thrift stores to SaaS.
From drummer to builder.

I keep it real. 🚀

𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗶𝗳𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝟮𝟴𝟲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴-𝗘𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗔𝗜: 𝗠𝘆 𝟯𝟬-𝗬𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆

I'm 62 years old, and I just launched an AI-powered app builder.

Let me tell you why age is your advantage, not your limitation.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝟭𝟵𝟵𝟱):
Walking through downtown San Diego thrift stores, buying 086, 286, 386, and 486 computers. Stacking them in my spare room. Learning DOS because Windows was a luxury.

Those command prompt skills everyone skips today? They're my superpower.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 (𝟭𝟵𝟵𝟱-𝟮𝟬𝟭𝟱):
For 10 years, I ran my own computer service company serving:
→ The Rotary Club
→ McDonald's
→ California State Parks  
→ Butte Interagency Narcotics Taskforce
→ Countless local businesses

Not flashy. Not venture-backed. Just solving real problems for real people.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹𝘀:
• Microsoft Registered Partner
• MSDST Certified
• HP Certified Technician
• Electronics Repair Specialist

But more importantly: I taught people. Built systems. Designed networks. Made technology accessible.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗹𝗼𝘁 𝗧𝘄𝗶𝘀𝘁:
I've also been a drummer and songwriter for 48 years. Sound engineer. Audio producer. Music taught me what tech couldn't: how to tell stories that move people.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝟮𝟳, 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱):
I wrote a song about AI called "I Keep It Real." Hip-hop beat, country-reggae fusion. About AI making us smarter without working harder.

Listen: https://suno.com/s/opZd3WQEdxAXHlU2

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 (𝗝𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝟴, 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟲):
12 days after writing that song, I launched PAPI Central:
• Cortex App Studio - Build apps with AI
• The Cortex Desktop - Desktop AI assistant
• Aegis Security Suite - Protection tools
• Automation Hub - One-click deployment

The song became reality.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗔𝗴𝗲 𝗜𝘀 𝗔𝗻 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲:

30 years of experience > 6-month bootcamp
Real problem-solving > Perfect syntax
Serving communities > Disrupting industries
Keeping it real > Fake it till you make it

I'm slow at typing, but I know what to say to AI. Because I've spent 30 years listening to what people actually need.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲:

If you think you're too old to start something new, you're wrong.
If you think your past experience is outdated, you're wrong.
If you think AI will replace you, you're REALLY wrong.

AI amplifies experience. And I've got 30 years of it.

Hi [Journalist Name],

This isn't your typical "20-something drops out to build startup" story.

Troy Walker is 62. He's been fixing computers since 1995, starting with 286s 
from San Diego thrift stores. He's also been playing drums and writing songs 
for 48 years.

On December 27, 2025, he wrote and produced a hip-hop song about AI called 
"I Keep It Real" (listen: https://suno.com/s/opZd3WQEdxAXHlU2)

12 days later, he launched PAPI Central - an AI-powered suite of development 
tools that does exactly what he was singing about.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀:

1. AGE: Proof that 30 years of DOS commands > 6 months of bootcamp
2. MUSIC: Artist-engineer hybrid perspective on AI collaboration
3. COMMUNITY: Built tools for real problems, not VC pitch decks
4. AUTHENTICITY: From Microsoft partner to AI founder, staying true to roots
5. SPEED: Song to SaaS in 12 days - true "building in public"
